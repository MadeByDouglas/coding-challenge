Overview for BMW tech office developer candidates

## Existing Code

If you have existing code you are proud of please follow these guidelines:

- Include a link to a hosted repository (GitHub Bitbucket etc.)
- There should be a README in the repo explaining what the project does (see more info below)
- It's fine if the project was a group project, but please make it clear to us which parts you contributed to
- Ideally the project is live and running somewhere that we can demo the project whether it is a hosted server or mobile app

## Readme Notes

Think of the readme as your extended resume. It should be professional for each project as if the the project were a live product. A good guideline might be:

- An overview of the problem and your approach to solve it
- Thought process behind any interesting design decisions
- Any challenges you came across, work arounds you had to implement, and improvements or changes you would want to make if you continued to work on it
- Link to the deployed app where applicable

## How we Review Candidates

Your application will be reviewed by at least 2 members of our team and often by the entire team. We value your past work experience as well as relatable coding projects. If you can show us your coding skills through a hobby project rather than traditional work experience, that is fine, we just need to see how it connects. We are primarily looking for skill set and culture fit, so share what seems relevant. We are constantly learning new SDKs and implementing brand new technologies which previously did not exist, so while expertise is certanly needed we also require an eagerness to learn new stacks and frameworks.
